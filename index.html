    <h1>The Old Man And the Sea</h1>
    <h3>Book's Summary</h3>
    <p> <em>The Old Man and the Sea </em>is about an old fisherman, Santiago, who struggles to catch a giant marlin after 84 days without a catch.

The story deeply symbolizes life’s struggles where the <em> sea </em> represents life itself, <em> fishing </em> stands for hard work and survival, and the <em> marlin </em> is a noble goal worth fighting for. Though Santiago returns with only the fish’s bones, his <em> endurance, bravery, and silent dignity </em> earn him deep respect. He fails in result, but <em> wins in spirit</em>.  <em> showing that true heroism lies in fighting with purpose, even when the world sees you as defeated. </em>
